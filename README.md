3. Plant-uml - Plant-uml will take the input grammar generated by the java-parser module and will draw the corresponding sequence diagram. 


To execute use the follwing commands :

1. For Class diagram : 

    java -jar uml-parser.jar class "C:\Path to the folder where files are located" image_name

    This will generate the class diagram in the input folder where your java files are present.
